            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Ships the 27 Iune 1629 and came vnder Tenerifa in the Canaries, where hee was in fight with the Armade of Don FREDE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RICO the 23. and 24. AuguÅ¿t. and the 4. September hee ariued in S. Vincent, where hee refreÅ¿hed, and the 29. Novem. came by him the Coronel D. van WARDENBURGE, as alÅ¿o did the Commander DIRRICK SYMONSZ come thither the 29. of the Å¿ame moneth, who Å¿ayled out of Texel with the Å¿aid Coronel the 20. October: The Fleet beeing then Å¿trong 50. Ships &amp; PinaÅ¿Å¿es, 2. PryÅ¿es and 13. great Shalloups, where was muÅ¿te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red 7280. Men iong and olde, towit 3780 Mariners and 3500 Souldiers. With which Forces according to his order hee Å¿ett his courÅ¿e towards the CoaÅ¿t of Pernambuco, and got land in Å¿ight the 2. February vpon 7. degrees 4. Minutes, and the 13. of February aboute C.S. AuguÅ¿tijn: Where was reÅ¿olued that the Coronell with 16. Ships and PinaÅ¿Å¿es, and 2400. Souldiers and 600. Mariners Å¿hould land 2. mile northwards of Pernam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buco in Rio Doce: and the Generall with the reÅ¿t of the Fleete and 2. Å¿trong Companies of Souldiers Å¿hould Å¿aile to the Recif. Which reÅ¿olution beeing taken, the 13. and 14. they prepared themÅ¿elves and all things readie, and the 15. by breake of the daye, with milde weather and a Å¿till Å¿ea, they began there EnterpriÅ¿e, towit the Generall Å¿etting towards the Recif vnto the Barra of Pernambuco, and the Coronell Wardenborge with his 16. Å¿aile, wherein was 2400. Souldiers and 600. Mariners, whoe beeing landed preÅ¿entlie Å¿et for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the appointed place.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:5162:2"/>
            <p>The Generall came to the Barra aforeÅ¿aid aboute noone, and Å¿ailed with Å¿om Å¿hips cloÅ¿e vnder the Fort, which lies vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Recif, vpon which hee plaied with his Ordinance vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the euening, and likewiÅ¿e vpon the land Forts. The Forts alÅ¿o plaied luÅ¿tilie vpon the Ships and with advantage, for the Ships coulde not Å¿hoote leuel by reaÅ¿on of the wauering of the Å¿ea, and when they lighted vpon the Walls, it made one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie whit Å¿pots without doeing anie damage to the Forts one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie a little at the verie top of the Walles.</p>
            <p>6. Ships and 11. PinaÅ¿Å¿es remained readie with Å¿male Å¿aile to run in, when warning Å¿hould bee giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> at high water, which was expected aboute 3. of the clock. But the Governour of Pernambuco it Å¿eemes was long afore advertiÅ¿ed of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of this Fleete, and therevpon had Å¿topped the mouth of the River of the Recif (namelie the Poco and Barette) with Å¿oncked Ships, and fenced the whole Vilage Povo vpon the land Recif with a little wall or breaÅ¿tworck, Å¿o that the Ships and PinaÅ¿Å¿es at that time could effect nothing, and the other Ships which laye-cloÅ¿e vnder the Wall were conÅ¿trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to drawe back toward the euening.</p>
            <p>In the meane while the Coronel Wardenborgh was buÅ¿ie with landing his Forces with Shalloups and Boates at the place appointed, and marched formoÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe with the vantguarde, in Å¿ight of his Enimies, who Å¿hewed themÅ¿elues Å¿trong both a foote and horÅ¿eback along the Å¿trand, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the reÅ¿t of the Forces followed out of the Ships, with 2 pieces of Ordinance which Å¿hott 3. pound iron, but the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning drawing on, they were conÅ¿trained to lodge one the Å¿trand vnder the Å¿kie that night.</p>
            <p>In the night time haueing made all preparation, the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning drawing one hee martched forwards corragiouÅ¿lie with all his Forces, parted in 3. Regiments and a partie of Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks, the vantguard vnder which the Coronell was himÅ¿elfe, was commaunded by Lieutennant EltÅ¿z: the Battaillion by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:5162:2"/>Lieutennant Steyncalenfels, and the rierguard by the Major Houx, haueing on there one Å¿ide a thik groue, out of which they feared much to bee annoyed.</p>
            <p>By Rio Doce which is a running River (where they were conÅ¿trained to march through to the middel) they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred of the Portingals, who laie there entrenched Å¿ome 1800. Å¿trong, the Å¿kirmidge was hot and ours put back twice, and manie Å¿laine and hurt one both Å¿ides, but moÅ¿t one the Enimies Å¿ide, and Å¿o at laÅ¿t they were put to flight.</p>
            <p>From thence the Coronell marched to the Towne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reÅ¿ting, takeing by the waye Å¿ome blaks, but learning noe intelligence from them, coming to the Towne they aÅ¿Å¿aulted the IeÅ¿uites CloÅ¿ter, the gates whereof were bolwerkt toe within Å¿ide, which beeing beaten open and all Å¿laine that reÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ted, the Enimies were forced to forÅ¿ake the CloÅ¿ter, leauing behinde manie dead and maimed.</p>
            <p>The Enimies forces in the Trenches and Forts one the Strand along the Sea, heareing Å¿uch newes, and perceiueing Major Houx coming againÅ¿t them with the reareguard, tooke the flight alÅ¿o after a little Å¿kirmidging, and playing of the Ordinance, leaueing behinde them Å¿ome few dead and hurt.</p>
            <p>In the meane time that the Coronell approached the Towne one the North Å¿ide, the Generall had landed 2. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies with good convenience one the South Å¿ide, and Å¿ent them to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t the Coronell, and Å¿o the Towne was aÅ¿Å¿aulted one both Å¿ides, in Å¿uch manner that aboute 4. of the clock in the afternoone it was ouercome with loÅ¿Å¿e of aboute 50. or 60. Souldiours.</p>
            <p>After the winning of the Towne there was found within but aboute 100. ChiÅ¿ts with Sugar, Å¿ome Wines, little Meal and other Å¿mall matters of little vallew, becauÅ¿e the Cittizens and Inhabitants were fled with moÅ¿t part of there goods, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withÅ¿tanding the Governour MATTHIAS d'ALBUQUERQUE had forbidden it vpon paine of death, that noe bodie Å¿hould
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:5162:3"/>flie, or carrie ought out of the Towne, becauÅ¿e the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants might help to keepe the Towne the better.</p>
            <p>In the night the Generall cauÅ¿ed the hauen mouthes to be founded, and the Forts to bee viewed, which the Enimie did holde Å¿tronglie beÅ¿et, Å¿o that there was Å¿male hope to doe anie good againÅ¿t them by water.</p>
            <p>The 17. February the Governour cauÅ¿ed all the PackhouÅ¿es to bee Å¿et on fire, wherein was aboue 15000. ChiÅ¿ts of Sugar, becauÅ¿e the Inhabitants were fled as a priÅ¿oner reported, which fire coulde not bee hindered by ours.</p>
            <p>The 20. after the Towne was well beÅ¿et and good order Å¿et in all things, there was reÅ¿olued by the CounÅ¿ell to make an EnterprinÅ¿e vpon the Fort, which layes vpon the land Recif; where to the Coronel commaunded the Lieutennant Steyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calenfelts with 400. or 500. Men, whoe quited himÅ¿elfe well in that Action, and Å¿tormed twoo houres in the night vpon the Fort, but beeing the Å¿kaling Ladders, which were raiÅ¿ed were found a faddem to Å¿hort, and that the gates coulde not bee opened, becauÅ¿e thoÅ¿e of the Å¿male Fort that lies vpon the Sea Recif, did much annoye ours with there Cannons, wee reÅ¿olued to retraite to Å¿pare our Men, leaueing behinde vs aboute 20. dead and 40. or 50. hurt.</p>
            <p>The 21. the Barrette beeing viÅ¿ited with Shalloups, whoe Å¿et fire on the Ship that the Enimies had Å¿unck in the mouth with Å¿tones to Å¿top the paÅ¿Å¿age, which Ship beeing fired, they found good convenience to come within the Recif with Shalloups, but Å¿eeing the Village vpon the Recif, where the PackhouÅ¿es were fired, was Å¿o fenced with Walles, BreÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woorks and PaliÅ¿ades, it was thought verie dangerous to land there to attempt anie thing againÅ¿t the Village.</p>
            <p>And the 22. beeing buÅ¿ie to Å¿trengthen the Towne with more Workes, and alÅ¿o the IeÅ¿uites CloÅ¿ter, and likewiÅ¿e in makeing a Bridge at the Foote of the Towne, which Å¿houlde come out ouer the Bar like a head a little Seawards to land;

            <p>The 23. was reÅ¿olued with approbation of all the Officers to drawe neare the Fort (that lies vpon the land Recif) with Approaches, whereto all preparation of FoÅ¿Å¿iues and Sconce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baÅ¿kets were made, moÅ¿t of the Mariners beeing imployed aboute cutting RijÅ¿work and makeing Sconce-baÅ¿kets, and others finiÅ¿heing of the Å¿aid Bridge.</p>
            <p>And the 25. haueing finiÅ¿hed diuers BreÅ¿tworks in manie Å¿treets of the Towne, againÅ¿t anie Å¿uddaine EnterpriÅ¿e of the Enimie, the Approaches towards the greate Fort were began the 29.

            <p>SEEING that with Gods aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance I haue victoriouÅ¿ly conquered this Towne of FARNABUCCO, I could not omitt according to my duty, participate vnto you, what is paÅ¿Å¿ed therein as farr as preÅ¿ent tyme will permitt.</p>
            <p>In the Bay of S. Vincent hauing found the Generall LONCK with his accompanyed Shipps, wee weare in all (after Å¿ome weekes being gathered together 53. Å¿ayles of Shipps, with healthy and Å¿ickly Souldiers, Å¿ayled from thence the 26. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemb. 1629. towards the coaÅ¿ts of BraÅ¿ill, where wee came the 12. February, in the clymake of 8. degrees, where there came vnto vs Å¿ome Shipps and Pynnaces, which had loÅ¿t vs and weare Å¿ent out before vs, Å¿o that afterwards wee weare 56. Å¿ayle; Whereafter Å¿erious deliberation wee reÅ¿olued to fall vpon the Ennemy in twoo places, to witte I with 2400. Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and 300. Saylers, with 300. Saylers more to the traine being deuided in 16. Shipps, were reÅ¿olued to land about 2. Myles towards the North of Fernambucco: And the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall LONCK hauing by him two other Å¿trong Companyes in the other Shipps towards the Recyf, hauing reÅ¿olued the 15. February to effect our enterpriÅ¿e. The Generall going to the Recyf, but by reaÅ¿on thoÅ¿e of the CaÅ¿tell had heard of our comming, they had Å¿unck certayne Å¿hipps in the mouth of the Hauen, Å¿o that the Generalls deÅ¿Å¿eyn toock noe effect allbeitt hee did his beÅ¿t indeauours with Å¿hott of Cannon; in the meane tyme in the afternoone I went towards the Å¿hoare in certayne Sloopes, where there did apeare many Souldiers, both foote and horÅ¿e; and being landed in their Å¿ight, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the reÅ¿t of our Souldiers followed out of the other Shipps with 2. Peeces that Å¿hott 3. <abbr>lb</abbr> Iron, and becauÅ¿e it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gann to growe euening, wee weare forced to lodge vpon the Å¿trand: Next morning very early I did Å¿end the Boats towards the Shipps, and Å¿eparated my Troupes in three Regiments.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:5162:6"/>The Auantguarde where I was in perÅ¿on, aÅ¿well in marching as in landing, was commaunded by Leftennant EltÅ¿z: The Battell by Leftennant Steyncallenfells: The Rierguarde by Major Houcks, marching on the Å¿trand towards the Towne, comming by Rio Dolce was a Å¿male Riuer, which wee weare forced to wade to the middle in water, where wee had the firÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿ault, wheare the Ennemy as I am aduiÅ¿ed weare about 1800 Men, both foote and horÅ¿e, did reÅ¿iÅ¿t vs but after a hard SkermiÅ¿h, and many being dead and hurt on both Å¿ides, but leaÅ¿t of our Å¿ide they weare putt to flight. NotwithÅ¿tanding they had a running Riuer for their aduantage. Comming Å¿omwhat further, Å¿tood another Troupe vpon the Å¿trand, but after little reÅ¿iÅ¿tance did alÅ¿o retired in the Woods, Å¿howing themÅ¿elues the third tyme, durÅ¿t not Å¿tay for vs; Å¿o that with all diligence Å¿eing them Å¿o frighted, I marched towards the Towne, drawing neare therevnto with the Auantguarde and Battaille, did amount vnto the IeÅ¿uitts CloyÅ¿ter, where the Backgates weare bollwarckt, and wee in clyming, Å¿awe them in the CloyÅ¿ter arme themÅ¿elues, but after Å¿ome reÅ¿iÅ¿tance, and hauing Å¿eene our courage, they fleyed, leauing behind them many dead and wounded, and of our Men weare alÅ¿o Å¿ome Å¿layne. In the meane tyme the Trenches and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes haueing notice heereof, and Å¿eing the Rearguarde, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Å¿o haÅ¿tily vpon them, after many Å¿hott with Canon, and Å¿ome dead and hurt, did alÅ¿o flie away, leauing behinde them their Fortes which weare, after Å¿trenghtened by our Men, and Å¿o with Gods mercy are become MaÅ¿ters of the Towne, hauing loÅ¿t in all about 50. or 60. Men.</p>
            <p>I haue beÅ¿ett the IeÅ¿uits CloyÅ¿ter (where I am lodged) with Trenches. The 20. February with conÅ¿ent of the CounÅ¿ell; wee did commaund Leftennant Steyncallenfells to make an EnterpriÅ¿e in the night vpon the Forte that Å¿tands vpon the Recyf towards the land, whoe hath quitted himÅ¿elfe therein, and Å¿tormed therevpon twoo houres long, but our lathers
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:5162:7"/>being to Å¿horte, was thought good to retire, to Å¿aue our men with the loÅ¿Å¿e of 20. dead and 40. hurt of our Men, and 12. of theirs. Wherevpon the 23. February hauing thought fitting with conÅ¿ent of the CounÅ¿ell, to fall vpon the Å¿ayd Towne with Approaches, wherevpon preÅ¿ent order was given for<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> preparation therevnto, which being done the 27. February<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> wee begann the Worke vnder commaund of Leftennant EltÅ¿z, who made the Å¿ame night a Trench againÅ¿t the CaÅ¿tell, betweene this Towne and the Recyf, and the day following the Battery allmoÅ¿t finiÅ¿hed, and when Major Houcx went to relieue him, I went thether alÅ¿o and Å¿tayed there till the day following till the Battery was finiÅ¿hed: and three half Cannon planted therevpon, and hauing Å¿hott all that day and next day being the Å¿econd currant, hauing alÅ¿o Å¿hott the whole morning till about 9. a cloack, began to parle with mee, and Å¿ett vp a white Å¿heete, Å¿ending a Captaine vnto vs with whom I haue agreed, that they leauing the Forte, Å¿hall departe without ancient or burning Matches, leauing behinde them all Artillery, as alÅ¿o all Amunition and ProviÅ¿ion, which wee thinck they haue caÅ¿te in the Sea and carryed away, becauÅ¿e wee found none therein. Further wee urged them to promiÅ¿e not to rayÅ¿e any Armes againÅ¿t the States in 6. Moneths. This being done, wee thought fitting to demaund the other CaÅ¿tel vpon the Recyf, which layes in the Sea. In the meane tyme the Generall, the Admirall and Vice-Admirall had notice thereof, who comming did approue thereof, and was putt in practiÅ¿e by Å¿ending a Drumme, and they Å¿ent out a Leften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but leauing another in hoÅ¿tage, with whom by authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from his Commandor wee agreed vpon conditions as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlie, which beeing preÅ¿entlie Å¿ubÅ¿cribed one both Å¿ides, they marched out, and Å¿o in the afternoone wee were maÅ¿ter of both Forts and Hauen, as alÅ¿o of the whole Recyf.
